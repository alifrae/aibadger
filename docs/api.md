# API Reference

Badger provides a supported, stable, non-interactive command surface for
editors, scripts, coding agents, and other local tools. The stable operations
are `topology`, `prompt`, `extract`, `review-context`, and
`review-continuation`. The official
[VS Code companion](https://github.com/PVRLabs/aibadger-vscode) uses this API
for Ask and Deep Review.

Use `badger api --help` for an overview or add `--help` (or `-h`) to a stable
operation for command-specific usage.

Every API command requires `--root <project>`, which must be an absolute or
relative path to an existing directory. Badger normalizes it to an absolute
path and uses it as the project root.

Input files (`--input`, `--goal-file`) are UTF-8, caller-managed files. Badger
reads them without modifying or retaining them. Caller-provided paths are
resolved relative to the current working directory, not the `--root`.

Usable output goes to stdout. Errors and warnings go only to stderr. A nonzero
exit status means the operation could not produce usable output. A zero exit
with content on stderr means usable output was produced alongside diagnostics
(for example, partial extraction with some failed selectors).

The API outputs only directly usable AI-facing text. It does not produce JSON,
structured topology, or extraction metadata. All existing safety rules apply:
`.badger-disable`, sensitive/binary file protection, external-context read-only
behavior, and size limits.

## Coding-agent usage

For an unfamiliar or non-trivial repository, a coding agent can use topology
near the beginning of a task:

```bash
badger api topology --root .
```

The agent should use the result to identify likely entrypoints, packages,
tests, configuration, and documentation, then continue with its native search,
file-reading, editing, and testing tools. Topology is a compact map, not a
substitute for reading source code.

Avoid rerunning topology during the same task unless the repository structure
has materially changed. Coding agents with direct repository access do not
normally need `prompt` or `extract`; those operations support Badger's existing
human AI-chat handoff workflow.

See [Agent Integrations](agents.md) for practical decision rules and usage
guidance.

## Human handoff integration flow

A human AI-chat integration normally uses two calls:

1. Run `api prompt` with the user's goal and send its complete stdout to the
   model.
2. Save the model's selector-only response, run `api extract`, and send that
   command's complete stdout back to the same model conversation.

Use `api topology` instead when an integration needs only Badger's compact
project map and will manage its own repository access.

## Commands

### `api review-context`

Print a complete review request from current Git state. “Complete” means the
output is directly usable without assembling another review-context envelope.
Topology is omitted unless `--include-topology` is explicitly requested.

```bash
badger api review-context --root <repository> \
  [--mode <default|staged|branch|commit>] [--ref <revision>] \
  [--input <guidance-file>] [--paths-file <paths.json>] \
  [--include-topology] \
  [--max-payload-bytes <bytes>] [--max-file-bytes <bytes>]
```

The default mode reviews staged and unstaged tracked changes and relevant
Git-untracked paths. `staged` reviews the index, `branch` reviews `HEAD` from
the merge base with `--ref`, and `commit` reviews the commit named by `--ref`.
Only default mode accepts `--paths-file`; that file is a UTF-8 JSON array of
literal repository-relative changed paths, for example
`["internal/client.go","deleted.go"]`. Badger validates and deduplicates the
paths, accepts current deleted paths, and rejects absolute, escaping, or
unchanged paths.

`--input` optionally supplies current review guidance. Both input files are
caller-owned, read once, and limited to 1 MiB. The byte-limit options must be
positive. Omitting them uses Badger's 512 KiB complete-prompt and 64 KiB
per-supporting-file defaults. The authoritative diff is mandatory; complete
eligible changed files are included only when they fit. Tracked additions,
deletions, binary files, sensitive files, oversized files, and untracked files
follow the status policy printed in the prompt.

The selected mode controls the authoritative fenced diff. Optional complete
supporting files are read from the current checked-out working tree at
generation time, including in staged, branch, and commit modes. Supporting
content may therefore be newer than the reviewed diff and never changes which
patch is authoritative.

The operation builds the complete AI-facing review request before writing
stdout. With `--include-topology`, Badger owns the project scan, source-tree
format, ordering, and shared payload budget; the authoritative diff remains
mandatory. Without that flag, topology is not inspected or included. It
exits nonzero without writing stdout for generation failures such as no changes,
an invalid Git root or ref, Git failure, invalid selections, or mandatory
overflow. A destination write failure also returns nonzero; as with any stream,
the destination may already contain a partial prefix when that happens. The
operation is non-interactive and read-only. It scans project topology only when
`--include-topology` is supplied. It does not read stdin, access the clipboard,
open the TUI or a browser, contact providers, or access the network. Normal
output uses repository-relative paths and does
not expose the absolute repository root.

Editor integrations can capability-check this operation with `badger api
--help` and `badger api review-context --help`; the latter advertises
`--include-topology` when supported. On success, stdout is the complete
request to copy verbatim; on failure,
stderr contains the
`Error: ...` diagnostic and stdout is empty. The command never writes to the
clipboard or contacts an AI provider.

### `api review-continuation`

Print supplemental context for an existing Deep Review conversation.

```bash
badger api review-continuation --root <repository> \
  --input <selector-file> \
  [--max-payload-bytes <bytes>] [--max-file-bytes <bytes>]
```

The input must contain only complete extraction selectors, one per non-empty
line. P1 supports `FILE:`, `PREFIX:`, `NEAR:`, `SYMBOL:`, `REFERENCES:`,
`TESTS:`, and `SEARCH:`. A findings-only response needs no continuation call.
Badger rejects findings-only, mixed prose-and-selector, empty, and malformed
responses rather than interpreting natural-language findings.

`SYMBOL:` extracts a bounded span from a known file. `REFERENCES:` and
`SEARCH:` perform case-sensitive literal discovery in the local project and
return at most 12 matched-file spans. `TESTS:` performs the same kind of
literal discovery over likely test paths and returns at most 8 spans. Discovery
scans at most 5,000 eligible files, skips symlinks and common dependency/build
noise, and skips binary/assets and files larger than 1 MiB. These operators are
not AST-, LSP-, compiler-, or type-aware semantic search.

Output contains compact continuation instructions and the requested context;
it does not repeat the initial diff, changed-file blocks, guidance, or
topology. Files are read from the current filesystem when this command runs and
may therefore be newer than the initial review context. Existing extraction
safety, deduplication, partial-success, and deterministic ordering rules apply.
A discovery selector with no match is reported as a failure while other usable
selectors may still produce output. Warnings go to stderr. Positive byte-limit
options override the normal Prompt 2 limits; the call fails without stdout if
no usable supplemental context fits.

### `api topology`

Print the project topology text.

```bash
badger api topology --root <project>
```

The topology is identical to the prompt section produced by `api prompt`, but
without the task or constraint sections. Useful for callers that need only the
project structure.

Example stdout (abbreviated):

```text
[PROJECT TOPOLOGY]
Languages: Go
Stack: Go Modules
Structure: Single Module

[SOURCE TREE]
Pkg: . [3 files] -> Top: README.md (4KB), go.mod (1KB), main.go (1KB)
Pkg: internal/client [4 files] -> Top: client.go (8KB), config.go (2KB)
...
```

The topology is AI-facing text rather than JSON. Callers can pass it directly
to a model or embed it in their own prompt.

#### Topology contract

`api topology`:

- is non-interactive and read-only;
- does not access the clipboard, open a browser, access the network, or change
  Badger settings;
- accepts an explicit repository root through `--root`;
- writes topology content to stdout and diagnostics only to stderr;
- returns a nonzero exit status when it cannot produce usable output;
- uses root-relative paths and does not expose the absolute repository root in
  normal output; and
- produces deterministic output for an unchanged repository.

The command can fail when its arguments or root are invalid, the project is
disabled with `.badger-disable`, or the repository cannot be scanned.

### `api prompt`

Print a complete Prompt 1 (Map) — topology plus task and extraction constraint.

```bash
badger api prompt --root <project> --focus <code|design> --input <goal-file>
```

`--focus` selects the initial instruction set. Supported values are `code` and
`design`. `--input <goal-file>` must point to a UTF-8 file containing the goal
or question for the AI.

For example, `goal.txt` might contain:

```text
Add timeout handling to the API client.
```

```bash
badger api prompt --root ./my-project --focus code --input goal.txt > prompt-1.txt
```

The resulting `prompt-1.txt` has this structure (abbreviated):

```text
[PROJECT TOPOLOGY]
...

[SOURCE TREE]
...

[TASK]
Add timeout handling to the API client.

[CONSTRAINT]
...
```

Send the complete stdout payload to the model. Prompt 1 contains topology and
file metadata, but not source-file contents. Its constraint asks the model to
return extraction selectors for the context it needs.

### `api extract`

Print a complete Prompt 2 (Code Context) — topology, task, and extracted source
code.

```bash
badger api extract --root <project> [--focus <code|design>] --input <selector-file> --goal-file <goal-file>
```

`--input <selector-file>` is a UTF-8 file containing the AI's extraction
selectors (`FILE:`, `PREFIX:`, `NEAR:`, `SYMBOL:`, `REFERENCES:`, `TESTS:`, or
`SEARCH:`), one per line. `--goal-file <goal-file>` is the same original goal
that was passed to `api prompt`. `--focus` selects the final-answer instruction
set and accepts `code` or `design`. It is optional for backward compatibility;
omitting it uses `code`. Callers that use a focus for `api prompt` should pass
the same focus to `api extract`.

For example, a model response saved as `selectors.txt` might contain:

```text
FILE:internal/client/client.go
SYMBOL:internal/client/config.go#Timeout
TESTS:ClientTimeout
SEARCH:retry budget
```

`FILE:` requests a complete file. `PREFIX:`, `NEAR:`, and `SYMBOL:` locate a
relevant source span in a known file. `REFERENCES:`, `TESTS:`, and `SEARCH:`
perform the bounded literal discovery described above. See the
[Protocol](protocol.md#step-2-extract) for the selector matching rules.

Use the same goal file from `api prompt`:

```bash
badger api extract \
  --root ./my-project \
  --focus code \
  --input selectors.txt \
  --goal-file goal.txt \
  > prompt-2.txt
```

The resulting `prompt-2.txt` has this structure (abbreviated):

```text
[PROJECT TOPOLOGY]
...

[TASK]
Add timeout handling to the API client.

[OUTPUT CONSTRAINT]
...

[CONTEXT]
--- File: internal/client/client.go (Full File) ---
...
--- End File ---
--- File: internal/client/client_test.go (Extracted Span) ---
...
--- End File ---
```

Send the complete stdout payload back to the same model conversation. Prompt 2
contains only the source context selected for extraction, subject to Badger's
safety and size limits.

If some selectors fail (file not found, ambiguous path, no discovery match, or
safety exclusion), the corresponding diagnostics go to stderr while any usable
extracted content is still written to stdout. The exit status is nonzero only
when no usable content can be produced.

## Error example

```bash
$ badger api prompt --root /nonexistent --focus code --input goal.txt
Error: validating api root: stat /nonexistent: no such file or directory
$ echo $?
1
```

All errors follow the same pattern: an `Error:` prefix on stderr and a nonzero
exit status. Help commands return zero, write help to stdout, and do not scan
the repository.
