**Map → Extract → Apply:** Smart local context bridge that prepares focused codebase snippets for any LLM chat.

## How it works

**1. Map**  
Enter your goal. Badger builds a prompt.  
↳ You copy it → paste into your AI chat

**2. Extract**  
AI replies asking for specific files.  
↳ You copy that → paste back into Badger

**3. Apply**  
Badger fetches those files, builds a second prompt.  
↳ You copy it → paste into AI → review before writing

✓ Fully local — nothing leaves your machine until you copy it  
✓ You control every paste and every write

Perfect for **Claude token saving**, local LLM workflows, code reviews, design sessions, and debugging.

## Why AI Badger?

- **Universal compatibility** — Works with any AI chat interface or local model
- **Local-first codebase context tool** — Complete privacy, no uploads
- **Token efficient** — Stop burning agent tokens on reviews, explanations, or brainstorming
- **Precise & lightweight** — Built in Go, fast, minimal overhead
- **Specialized modes** — `review` and `design` for common workflows

Also available with an official [VS Code companion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pvrlabs.ai-badger).

## Agent Skills

Badger includes the `handoff` and `badger-review` skills for continuing an AI
coding session or requesting an independent review. See the [Agent Skills
guide](skills/README.md) for installation, usage, and details.

## Quick Start

1. Run `badger` in your project root. Interactive sessions start in Design focus.
2. Type your goal (or leave the editor empty and press Enter to explore the project).
3. Copy **Prompt 1** → paste into your AI chat.
4. When the AI asks for files, copy its response → paste back into Badger.
5. Copy **Prompt 2** → paste back to the AI.
6. Paste the AI’s response into Badger → review and apply changes.

### Specialized Modes
- `badger code` — explicitly start in Code focus
- `badger review` — Git changes and bounded supporting context for immediate findings
- `badger design` — explicitly start in Design focus with an empty editor
